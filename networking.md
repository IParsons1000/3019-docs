# Networking

## Overview

![Network Diagram](network.png "On-Robot Network Diagram")

The robot has an onboard network mediated by the :ref:`radio`, which includes the :ref:`roborio` and the :ref:`Coprocessors`.  The :ref:`driverstation` connects to these devices over the wifi access point provided by the radio, called "FRC 3019".  For :ref:`vision` to work properly, the network should be configured with static IP's as shown in the above network diagram.
