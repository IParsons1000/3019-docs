# Radio

## Overview

The robot uses a Vivid Hosting VH-109 FRC Radio as a network switch and wifi access point.  The radio must be carefully configured to ensure consistent access and operation.

The access point is available over wifi at "FRC-3019".

The radio *will* overheat if not attached to metal or some other heatsink.

## Installation

### Flashing

You may need to run the [Network Assistant Tool](https://frc-radio.vivid-hosting.net/overview/programming-your-radio-at-home/network-assistant-tool) in order to access the configuration page.

It is always necessary to update the firmware, following the instructions on [this page](https://frc-radio.vivid-hosting.net/overview/upgrading-firmware).

## Configuration

DIP switch 3 must be on for access point mode.

Access the configuration page at [radio.local](https://radio.local/).

Set the team number to 3019 and leave the suffix empty.

The password should be written on the tape stuck to the radio.  If that is not present, set a password and attach it to the radio.
